dOrganaizer
===========
Desktop Tasks Organizer.

This is a project for task organizing.
It's inspired by Brian Tracy's 'Eat That Frog' book.

In short the book represents the following rules for better time management.

1:Put your goals.
2:Plan everyday tasks.
3:Follow the 80/20 rule (80% of the benefit comes from 20% of the tasks).
4:Divide daily time on big non-breakable intervals in which to focus hard on the most important task.
5:Prioritize the task and always take the hardest and more important first.
6:Found your obstacles and make them irrelevant.
7:Stay motivated and positive.
