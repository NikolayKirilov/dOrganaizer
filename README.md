===========
Desktop Tasks Organizer.

This is a project for task organizing.
It's inspired by Brian Tracy's 'Eat That Frog' book.

In short the book represents the following rules for better time management.

1:Put your goals.
2:Plan everyday tasks.
3:Follow the 80/20 rule (80% of the benefit comes from 20% of the tasks).
4:Think about the consequences of a task done or not done.
5:Prioritize the task and always take the hardest and more important first.
6:Focus on the most important one.
7:Time is never enough. But enough for the most important things.
8:Prepare yourself and the environment before you begin.
9:Improve yourself.
10:Improve your specific talents (the things you love and do best).
11:Remove the obstacles of each task.
12:Step by step on bigger tasks.
13:Put strict deadlines and push yourself.
14:Define your most productive hours and use them properly.
15:Stay motivated positive and active (take relax when needed).
16:Creativity and filtration (leave/postpone the unimportant tasks).
17:Always the most important first.
18:Fragment big tasks (so you can complete them step by step).
19:Time slicing - divide daily time on big non-breakable intervals in which to focus hard on the most important task.
20:Use urgency to complete the key tasks.
21:Prioritize the task and always take the hardest and more important first up to the finish.
